# Higher Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition for Robust Parameter Estimation in Power Grids

![alt text](URL_of_image "PROPOSED METHODOLOGY")

This projects shows  the potential of HODMD is examined
for the estimation of fundamental frequency, amplitude, and the
existence of disturbance components, such as harmonics. In the
proposed methodology, HODMD modes are computed using the
low-rank approximation and then extracted the amplitude and
frequency information from the data. The hyper parameters of
the proposed methodology are properly tuned to get an accurate
estimate of the underlying parameters. The optimistic results
on various synthetic and real-time scenarios indicate that the
proposed methodology can be used to estimate the power system
frequency and amplitude in general periodic and quasi-periodic
dynamics.
